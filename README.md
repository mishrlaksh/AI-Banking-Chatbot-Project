# BankerBot Chatbot Project

This project creates a chatbot named **BankerBot** using Amazon Lex. BankerBot helps users check their bank account balances and transfer funds between accounts. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to setting up, deploying, and testing BankerBot using Amazon Lex and AWS CloudFormation.

## Project Overview

The project consists of five main parts:

1. **Set Up a New Lex Chatbot** – Create the basic structure and initial intents for BankerBot, including connecting it with AWS Lambda.
2. **Create the TransferFunds Intent** – Add an intent to handle funds transfers.
3. **Explore Cool Features in Amazon Lex** – Use Amazon Lex’s conversation flow and visual builder.
4. **Deploy with AWS CloudFormation** – Automate bot deployment with a CloudFormation template and Lambda function code.
5. **Clean Up Resources** – Delete resources to avoid charges.

## Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Basic knowledge of Amazon Lex and Lambda functions
- Installed AWS CLI (optional, for advanced management)

## Project Setup

1. **Delete Existing Resources** – If you've created bots or Lambda functions for similar projects, delete them to avoid confusion.
2. **Log in to AWS** – Ensure you’re using the **Lex V2** console.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Part 1: Set Up a New Lex Chatbot

#### 1. Create BankerBot
- **Navigate to Amazon Lex** in your AWS console.
- Select **Create bot** > **Create a blank bot**.
  - **Bot name**: `BankerBot`
  - **Description**: `Banker Bot to help customers check their balance and make transfers.`
  - **IAM Permissions**: Create a role with basic Amazon Lex permissions.
  - **Idle session timeout**: 5 minutes (default).
- Click **Done**.

#### 2. Set Up `WelcomeIntent`
- **Intent name**: `WelcomeIntent`
- **Description**: `Welcoming a user when they say hello.`
- **Sample utterances**:
  ```plaintext
  Hi
  Hello
  I need help
  Can you help me?
  ```
- **Closing response**:
  ```plaintext
  Hi! I'm BB, the Banking Bot. How can I help you today?
  ```
- **Save intent**, **Build**, and **Test** by entering “Hi” to see if the bot responds as expected.

#### 3. Manage `FallbackIntent`
- Add **FallbackIntent** with closing response:
  ```plaintext
  Sorry, I’m having trouble understanding. Can you describe what you’d like to do?
  ```
- Add **variations**:
  ```plaintext
  Hmm, could you try rephrasing that? I can help you find your account balance, transfer funds, and make a payment.
  ```
- **Save intent**, **Build**, and **Test**.

#### 4. Create `accountType` Custom Slot
- **Slot name**: `accountType`
- **Values**:
  - `Checking`
  - `Savings`
  - `Credit` (with synonyms: `credit card`, `visa`, `mastercard`, `amex`, `american express`)

#### 5. Create `CheckBalance` Intent and Attach Lambda Function
- **Create a Lambda Function** for balance retrieval:
  - Go to **AWS Lambda** in the AWS console.
  - Choose **Create function** > **Author from scratch**.
  - **Function name**: `BankingBotCheckBalance`
  - **Runtime**: Python 3.12
  - **Paste code** for retrieving random balance data in `lambda_function.py`.
  - Click **Deploy**.
- **Attach Lambda to CheckBalance Intent**:
  - Return to **Lex console** and open `BankerBot`.
  - In **Intents**, choose **Add intent** > **Add empty intent**.
  - **Intent name**: `CheckBalance`
  - **Description**: `Intent to check the balance in the specified account type.`
  - **Sample utterances**:
    ```plaintext
    What’s the balance in my account?
    Check my account balance
    What’s the balance in my {accountType} account?
    ```
  - **Slots**:
    - `accountType` – Prompt: `For which account would you like your balance?`
    - `dateOfBirth` – Prompt: `For verification purposes, what is your date of birth?`
  - **Fulfillment**:
    - Expand **On successful fulfillment**.
    - Select **Lambda function** `BankingBotCheckBalance` for the fulfillment.
  - **Save intent**, **Build**, and **Test**.

### Part 2: Create the `TransferFunds` Intent

#### 1. Set Up Intent
- **Intent name**: `TransferFunds`
- **Description**: `Help user transfer funds between bank accounts`

#### 2. Add Sample Utterances
- Sample utterances:
  ```plaintext
  Can I make a transfer?
  I want to transfer funds
  I'd like to transfer {transferAmount} from {sourceAccountType}
  ```

#### 3. Define Slots
- **Slots**:
  - `sourceAccountType` – Prompt: `Which account would you like to transfer from?`
  - `targetAccountType` – Prompt: `Which account are you transferring to?`
  - `transferAmount` – Prompt: `How much money would you like to transfer?`

#### 4. Set Up Confirmation and Closing Responses
- **Confirmation prompt**:
  ```plaintext
  Got it. So we are transferring {transferAmount} from {sourceAccountType} to {targetAccountType}. Can I go ahead?
  ```
- **Decline response**:
  ```plaintext
  The transfer has been canceled.
  ```
- **Closing response**:
  ```plaintext
  The transfer is complete. {transferAmount} should now be available in your {targetAccountType} account.
  ```

#### 5. Save, Build, and Test

---

### Part 3: Explore Cool Features in Amazon Lex

#### 1. Use Conversation Flow
- Review the conversation flow for `TransferFunds` to visualize steps in user interaction.

#### 2. Use Visual Builder
- Access the **Visual builder** to see the chatbot’s flow chart. This can help with planning and editing the conversation flow.

---

### Part 4: Deploy with AWS CloudFormation

#### 1. Deploy Using CloudFormation and Lambda Function
- **Download the Template**: Use `banker-bot.yaml`.
- **Upload Template**:
  - Navigate to **CloudFormation** > **Create stack**.
  - **Upload** the template file.
  - **Stack name**: `banker-bot-yourname`
  - **Submit** and wait for **CREATE_COMPLETE** status.
- **Upload Lambda Function Code**:
  - In **AWS Lambda**, create a new function `BankingBotLambda` for chatbot fulfillment.
  - Upload the `BankingBotEnglish.py` code.
  - Attach this Lambda to the intents defined in CloudFormation.
  
#### 2. Test the Deployed Bot
- In **Amazon Lex**, open the deployed bot and start testing.
- **Troubleshooting**:
  - If errors occur, ensure Lambda permissions allow the Lex bot to call it.

---

### Part 5: Clean Up Resources

1. **Delete the CloudFormation Stack**
   - In **CloudFormation**, select the stack and **Delete** it to clean up all resources.

2. **Delete Additional Resources**:
   - Delete any Lambda functions created manually.
   - Delete the CloudWatch log group associated with the chatbot testing.

---

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you’ll have successfully set up, deployed, and tested BankerBot. Remember to delete all resources upon completion to avoid AWS charges.
